This is my own guidelines about this project.
First of all, this project to make less thinking, more quickly to check about your runes when you get it. 

Basic Part
    Set up only for % and SPD
	    Go for 1/3 then 5 and after that is 2/4/6
Advance Later
	Go for flat stat leftover 
		Go 1/3 then go to 5 and 2/4/6 later 
			Then we will count in the Set bonus
				After that is the Team Set bonus
Upgrade more
	Update for Ancient Runes
		Add Reapp
			Add Grindstone and Enchanted gem
